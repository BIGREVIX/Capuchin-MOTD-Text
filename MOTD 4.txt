Hey! This is a HUGE update so lets get stuff out the way lol

First, lets make something clear i have setup a new multiplayer system known as photon. Photon has WAAAAY more to offer with different types of code and stuff like that. But
the microphone quality is gonna be lower due to me not paying for photon servers.

Second, Haptics have been added. You probably already noticed but either way still, its super cool!

Third, The MOTD (or message of the day) i can update this board when ever i feel like it, and not have to update the game.

Forth, The Player Model, it looks like trash but i needed to through something together really quick. it'll change in the future.

Thats really it for the upda-

Ohhhh ya if you look to your left, go in the tunnel and see the new area!

Anyway thats it for this huge update, Enjoy!
